What is it
----------

It is a markdown pre-processor that runs code inside *code blocks*, by
pasting the output back into the original document. Regarding output:

-   The default output is HTML+SVG while option `-g` forces HTML+PNG.

-   If you need markdown, use `-r` for Markdown+PNG. If you need
    Markdown+PDF (compatible with pdf generation in pandoc), use `-p`.

News
----

As of March 2015, I am rewriting the documentation of the plugins. Stay
tuned for other updates.

Available plugins:
------------------

To see the list of currently available plugins and links to the docs,
type:

``` {.bash}
> exemd list
```

If you are on NPM.js, look
[here](http://www.vittoriozaccaria.net/exemd/) for more examples.

Syntax
------

Each Markdown code block should begin with the language specifier
followed by a bang (`!`) between brackets `{}`, e.g., if you have a
diagram in the dot language:

    ```{dot !}

    digraph {
            a -> b[label="0.2",weight="0.2"];
            a -> c[label="0.4",weight="0.4"];
            c -> b[label="0.6",weight="0.6"];
            c -> e[label="0.6",weight="0.6"];
            e -> e[label="0.1",weight="0.1"];
            e -> b[label="0.7",weight="0.7"];
        }

    ```

`exemd` will invoke the `exemd-dot` plugin (which should be installed
separately). The plugin will parse the block code by invoking the actual
`dot` executable and the parsed `svg` will be pasted into the final
markdown (or html).

Depending on the plugin, you can also pass parameters (just as in
org-mode)

    ```{plugin-name ! plugin parameters string}


    ```

Plugins
-------

**This section is obsolete**, wait for the new documentation that should arrive soon.

Look for npm modules prefixed with `exemd`. I wrote only `exemd-dot` and
`exemd-ditaa` for diagrams. Feel free to provide plugins for R (like
`kintr`) or other languages.

Each plugin should export a `process(block, opts)` function, where:

-   `block` is the string representing the inner part of the block code
-   `opts` is an object with the following properties:

    -   `tmpdir` an already setup temporary directory where the plugin
        can mess around but not delete.
    -   `params` the string following the bang (`!`) in the block
        declaration
    -   `target-mode` it can be either `html`, `pdf`, or `raw`

The `process` function should return the markdown text to replace the
original block either directly or through a promise.
